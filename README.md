# TuneText

TuneText is a web application that combines YouTube's video library with the Genius API's lyrical database. Users can search for songs by entering the artist's name and song title, and the app retrieves the corresponding YouTube video and synchronizes it with the song's lyrics. TuneText aims to provide a one-stop destination for users to enjoy their favorite songs while exploring the meaning behind the lyrics. The app offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface, allowing users to engage with their beloved songs in a new and immersive way.
